### Installing FFmpeg on Windows:



* Download the FFmpeg executable for Windows from the official website: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows
Extract the downloaded file to a directory on your computer, for example, C:\ffmpeg.
Add the FFmpeg executable to your system's PATH environment variable. This will allow you to run FFmpeg from the command line or terminal.
Open the Control Panel and search for "Environment Variables."
Under "System Variables," scroll down and find the "Path" variable, then click "Edit."
Click "New" and enter the path to the FFmpeg executable, for example, C:\ffmpeg\bin.
Click OK to save the changes.
Open the command prompt and type ffmpeg -version to check the installation.
